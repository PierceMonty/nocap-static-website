NOCAP
Non Obtrusive Central Authentification Partnership/Pact/Pack/Party

NOCAP is a central, isolated authentification service. Instead of giving your personal
information to every company, trusting them to use your data correctly, why not limit
it to just one? NOCAP service provides you with a central, secure place to verify your
online presense, lifting the burden of trusting mega corporations with your data and 
leaving it with cyber-security professionals. 

It seems like every website you visit wants your personal data to 'make sure you're a 
real person'. While it is in these companies' interests to not accept bot accounts, they
do an awful job and still get away with loads of your personally identifying and precious 
data. Instead of giving facial recognition data, date of births, home addressses, phone 
numbers and more for every account of every service you use, you can rely on just us 
to vouch your legitamacy to these companies, while we secure and respect your data. 

NOCAP swears to your privacy. I myself, Pierce Montgomery, swears to your privacy. I am a
cyber security major growing up in a world seeing our private lives falling into the hands
of mega corporations, who use, sell, and resell our data to feed algorithms, target selected
ads, and much more. For more information, search up the term 'social cooling'. This is not
a problem that we can longer ignore. 

Join me and the NOCAP family and make sure that your data is secure. Verify your identity 
without sacrificing your data's integrity. It's tough to build trust, but I'm asking you to 
have faith while I try my best to protect our private lives from greedy big buisnesses who
know you better than yourself.
