<h2><abbr title="Non Obtrusive Central Authentification Party">NOCAP</abbr></h2>

<h5>hosted at Digital Ocean</h5>
<p> NOCAP is a long term project, and will stay a WIP for a while. <br> 
I don't have much experience in cyber security yet, and I am almost a novice programmer, <br>
but I would like to focus on learning how to start a small scale project from the ground up. <br>
Right now though, I'm mainly just focusing on self-improvement and doing shit that I've <br>
wanted to do for a while. Ie. reading lots of philosophy books, going on hiking trips, etc. <br> 
If you want to hire me for an internship or apprenticeship ship or an actual job, feel free <br>
to contact me at piercemontgomery (at) protonmail (dot) com. </p>
